## Introduction

It has been a long time since I graduated from university, and I think this is the right time to refresh my mathematical skill, as inspired by this blog post [^10]. This page serves as a progress tracker.

## Subjects

Subjects are listed below:

* Single Variable Calculus âœ…
* Multivariable Calculus
* Differential Equations
* Complex Analysis
* Linear Algebra ðŸš§
