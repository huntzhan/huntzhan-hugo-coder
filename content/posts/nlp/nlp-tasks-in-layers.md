# Introduction

Recently, [sebastianruder/NLP-progress](https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress) has drawn a lot of attention for collecting popular NLP tasks as well as the SOTA papers for those tasks. For the better understanding of the "big picture", I'm trying to catergorize those tasks in [a linguistic way](https://towardsdatascience.com/linguistic-knowledge-in-natural-language-processing-332630f43ce1).
