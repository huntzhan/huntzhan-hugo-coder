## Introduction

This page tracks my  reading roadmap of deep learning papers. I will update this page occasionally (probably every 3 - 5 days) according to my progress.

Notation:

*   ✔️: Done.
*   ❤️: Impressive!
*   🤔: Probably this work is controversial.
*   🏷️: Added to todo list but haven't started yet.
*   🚧: Ongoing.

## Deep Learning Theory And Practice

*   General
    *   Highway connections. [^12] [^13] 
*   LSTM
    *       The original formulation. [^1] 🏷️
    *       BPTT. [^21] [^20] [^22] 🚧
    *       Forget gate. [^2] 🏷️
    *       Peephole connections. [^4] 🏷️
    *       The vanilla LSTM achieved by incorporating [^2] [^4] and full BPTT into [^1], which is the most popular LSTM architecture nowadays. [^5] 🚧
    *       Gradient norm clipping. [^6] 🏷️
    *       DropConnect dropout. [^7] ✔️
    *       Variational dropout. [^8] 
    *       Recurrent projection. [^10] 
    *       Residual connections. [^9] 
    *       GRU. [^11] 
    *       An empirical study on the LSTM architecture. This paper shows that none of the variants is significantly better than the vanilla LSTM. [^3] 🚧❤️
*   Transformer
    *   The paper [^16] and the annotated version [^17]. 🏷️
    *   Universal transformer. [^19] 
    *   Transformer-XL. [^18] 
*   CNN
    *   TCN. [^15] ✔️
*   Optimizer
    *   AMSGRAD. [^14] 🚧
